# File Organizer

Just install it and then run `file-organizer some/root/path some/folder/to/copy`

If you would like to modify the routes of the folders you should modify `src\ImageClassifier\imageClassifier.ts` and then rebuild the project with a `npm build`. Afterwards you should run the command previously stated.
